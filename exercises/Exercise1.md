## 13.1.1. Logging in to the external server
Using your terminal, log in to either `itf-appn-test01.hpc.uio.no` (group 1-5 do this) or `itf-appn-test02.hpc.uio.no` (group
6-10). If you have forgotten how to do this, refer back to the [exercises from Module 7](https://github.com/BIOS3010/Module-7---HTS/blob/main/00-Get_started.md#logging-on-to-the-server).

```diff
! In your home directory, make a directory called `Module13` 
! Navigate into the newly created `Module13` folder
```

```diff
+ Hint:
+ You should remember how to do this, but if not revisit exercise 1.3.9 and 1.3.3
```

## 13.1.2. Downloading the RNA-seq data
First, we need to download the required RNA-seq data:
```diff
! Download: ftp://ftp.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/ddbj_database/dra/fastq/ERA294/ERA294220/ERX424840/ERR458493.fastq.bz2
! Decompress the file
```
```diff
Note: 
+ Forgotten how to download files? revisit exercise 1.4.11
+ Forgotten how to decompress files? revisit exercise 1.4.12
```
